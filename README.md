# CuteAlienVSPreditor

Cute alien trying to escape the preditors
Help the alien run for his life by using all the arrow keys.
You can move in any direction but cannot exit the screen borders.
see how long you can last and -> Don't let the predators touch you!

Some of the Main Components:
> Implemented physical static 2d borders which prevent the player from exiting and may have negative positioning effect on the player if he pushes too hard.

> Implemented auto random spawning enemies which run to the player at random times and speeds. The player may think the timing is constant but he will soon find out it is not.

> Implemented a real time timer to show the player his reached time.

> Implemented Game Over screen

> Implemented restart button
